A malicious wireless AP has been popping up in your work space. One of your network engineers was able to get the admin password hash, which appears to be MD5.
In order to better investigate the purposes of this router, you want to log in with the admin user and check the settings.

There was a label on the bottom of the router which said "cowboys####" so we're assuming that has something to do with the password.

Goal: Write a script to try all permutations of "cowboys####" checked against the MD5 hash. If that doesn't work, step through the
      word "cowboys" making each letter capital and trying all 10,000 versions. Submit your answer, and the script for a win! You
      can find the password hash in the "hash.txt" file of this directory.
