One of your network admins has noticed some strange findings in a network log. It appears there are multiple computers attempting to attack our network.
We need you to find out exactly what MAC addresses and IP addresses we should investigate further.

Goal: Write a script to search "fake-log.txt" and find any occurrence of the MAC addresses listed in "tgt.txt" as well as any additional MAC addresses
      that we should be interested in. The way we determine if we're interested in them or not, is if any one MAC address connected via a different
      IP at a different time. Submit your script and the answers for a win!
