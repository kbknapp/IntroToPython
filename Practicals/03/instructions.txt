It appears the recent attacks were part of an organized ring of inside attacks. One of our network engineers has been able to capture phone logs using company phones.
We've pulled the phone records for the suspected time period, as a list of those we suspect are involved. We need you to find out who the ring
leader is, and as a bonus diagram out their organization.

Goal: Write a script to analyze the contact books, vs the overall phone records. Keep in mind, if there are numbers in the phone records not listed in the contact
      books, we aren't interested in them. We only want to know about contacts and their links in the "contacts.txt" files.

Bonus: Use the Linux program "graphviz" and it's command line application "dot" to draw a diagram of the organization.

Hint: To use "dot" you must make your script write out a dot-format. For example, the following output shows three "nodes", connected in a tree.

digraph contacts {
    N1[label="Bob"];
    N2[label="Rick"];
    N3[label="Mike"];
    N1->N2[label=""];
    N1->N3[label=""];
}


If that output is saved as "contacts.dot" the following command line run would produce a graph file

dot -Tpng example.dot > example.png


See "example.png" for an example graph.
